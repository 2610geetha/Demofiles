# Bike Sharing Case Study
> Problem Statement:
A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state.

Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market. The company wants to know:

Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes.
How well those variables describe the bike demands

Objective:
Identify the variables affecting Bike sharing.

To create a linear model that quantitatively relates Bike sharing with variables provided in dataset.

To know the accuracy of the model, i.e. how well these variables can predict Bike Sharing prices.

## Conclusions
 Comparision between Training and Testing dataset:
    - Train dataset R^2          : 0.836
    - Test dataset R^2           : 0.8122
        
    - Train dataset Adjusted R^2 : 0.832   
    - Test dataset Adjusted R^2  : 0.802

Demand of bikes depend on year, holiday, temp, windspeed, sep,sun, Light_snowrain, Misty, spring, summer and winter.
